# Trans Canada Trail — Company Knowledge Repository

This repository is the **authoritative source of core organizational knowledge** for Trans Canada Trail.

It contains foundational materials that define **who we are, how we operate, how we communicate, and where we are going**.  
This repository is intended to support staff, leadership, and internal AI systems with a single, trusted source of truth.

If information elsewhere conflicts with this repository, the contents of this repository should be treated as **authoritative**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Centralize Trans Canada Trail’s core organizational knowledge
- Ensure consistency across communications, decision-making, and systems
- Support onboarding, governance, and institutional memory
- Power internal AI tools and assistants with vetted, version-controlled knowledge
- Reduce ambiguity by clearly defining what is considered “official”

This is not a general document archive. It is a **curated knowledge base**.

## Current Scope (Initial Core)

This repository intentionally starts with **foundational documents only**.  
Additional material will be added incrementally as the knowledge base matures.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for:

- Trans Canada Trail staff and leadership
- Approved contractors and partners (read-only, where appropriate)
- Internal AI tools and assistants

## Governance & Maintenance

- This repository represents official organizational knowledge
- Changes should be intentional and reviewed before merging
